# readmeMaker

This is the README for the README generator, 
not to be confused with the README generated by the README generator,
that README is called readme1, while this README is called README.

This README describes the README genereator, and how it generates READMEs,
while the readme1 README may describe anything I plug into the README generator, 
including information about this README generator, 
which happens to be the information I did choose to plug into the README Generator, 
so in theory, the readme1 REAMDE generated by the README generator should also give info about the README Generator,
but structured differently. 

This needs to be improved a bit. I repeated code, the readme1 README is not very pretty. 
But, the generator is successful in that a user can input information about their project, 
and a README will be created displaying that information.
